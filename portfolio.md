# [Studium](https://b-whitman.github.io/studium/)

*Distraction-free flashcard app*

I was assigned to this project as during my Lambda “Labs” unit, a 16-week team project where we followed a product through two release cycles. Our product was Studium, a flashcard studying app intended to combine flexibility, usability and insight. In our Product Vision, we saw ourselves catering to users who wanted some of the customizability of Anki, but with a cleaner user experience inspired by some of Anki’s web-based competitors.

# [Saltiest Hacker News Trolls](https://b-whitman.github.io/shnt/)

*Web comment sentiment analysis*

I was assigned to this project during my Lambda “Build Sprint,” a two-week team project. Our task was to categorize comments from the website Hacker News by how “salty” they were. The particular task I owned on the data science team was to procure additional comment data via the Hacker News API.

# [See You At The Movies!](https://b-whitman.github.io/syatm/)

*Box office revenue predictor*

Movies are big business. Global box office was worth $136 billion in 2018, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/box-office-record-disney-dominates-1203098075/). But it can be tough to predict what kind of return a movie will earn at the box office. Movie producers are faced with a difficult problem: Given a certain amount of money to fund new productions, how can you keep profits high and minimize box office duds? A predictive model based on machine learning principles seems like a good candidate here!

# Data Storytelling Project

The web is rife with fascinating datasets pieced together by enthusiasts, and IMDb is a prime example. I discovered that IMDb offers much of its data in .tsv format, so I decided to load that data into a Colab notebook and try to see if I could reach any interesting conclusions.
