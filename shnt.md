# The Plan

The team member in charge of engineering a machine learning solution for sentiment analysis wanted as many comments as she could get, to ensure the saltiness leaderboards were well-populated. I set out to learn to use the Python Hacker News API. To source comments, I needed to iterate through every individual object uploaded to Hacker News, be they comments, stories, or jobs. For each item, the program would check if it was a comment; if so, it would be stored in a database.

# The Product

Unfortunately, the web front-end for Saltiest Hacker News Trolls is no longer functional, so I don’t have a link to use to view it. However, I can show some screenshots of the data science work.

# In Retrospect

I’m pleased to have spent the time learning a somewhat unwieldy API, but I must admit I’m not sure my work was of all that much value to the finished product. Looking back, the amount of time my script took to record all those comments may not have been worth the benefit brought by having additional comments. Given the extremely limited time we had to work on this product, my time may have been better spent on something closer to the interface point between the web engineers and our work on the data science team.

However, I still treasure the experience I had on this Build Sprint. This was my first chance to witness and take part in team dynamics, and I learned lessons in these two weeks that I still carry with me to this day. Lessons about taking initiative; about speaking up; about listening to my gut and rejecting complacency; about my own work habits, and ultimately about my values.
